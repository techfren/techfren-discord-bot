# TechFren Discord Bot

A simple Discord bot built with discord.py.

## Features

- Processes queries via mentions (`@botname <query>`) anywhere in messages and responds with AI-generated answers using OpenRouter by default
- Summarizes channel conversations with `/sum-day` command to get a summary of the day's messages
- Summarizes channel conversations with `/sum-hr <hours>` command to get a summary of the past N hours
- Automatically generates daily summaries for all active channels at a scheduled time
- Stores summaries in a dedicated database table and optionally posts them to a reports channel
- Automatically cleans up old message records after summarization to manage database size
- Automatically splits long messages into multiple parts to handle Discord's 2000 character limit
- Processes URLs shared in messages:
  - Uses Apify to scrape Twitter/X.com URLs, extracting tweet content, video URLs, and replies
  - Uses Firecrawl for all other URLs
  - Summarizes content and stores it in the database
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (10 seconds between requests, max 6 requests per minute)
- Mention-based queries (e.g., `@botname <query>`) allow you to interact with the bot in any channel, with responses posted in threads attached to your original message. Mentions can appear anywhere in the message (beginning, middle, or end)
- `/sum-day` command works in any channel
- Stores all messages in a SQLite database for logging and analysis

## Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed (required for asyncio.to_thread functionality)
3. Create a virtual environment:
   ```
   uv venv
   ```
4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Unix/macOS

   python bot.py
   ```

## Discord Developer Portal Setup

To use the message content intent, you need to enable it in the Discord Developer Portal:

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications/)
2. Select your application/bot
3. Navigate to the "Bot" tab
4. Scroll down to the "Privileged Gateway Intents" section
5. Enable the "Message Content Intent"
6. Save your changes
7. Uncomment the message_content intent in the bot.py file

## Commands

### Basic Commands

- `@botname <query>`: Sends your query to the configured AI model and returns the response. This command works in any channel and creates a thread attached to your message where the bot's response is posted. The mention can appear anywhere in your message (e.g., "Hey everyone, @botname can you help with this?").

### Channel Summarization

- `/sum-day`: Summarizes all messages in the current channel for the current day
  - Works in any channel (not restricted to #bot-talk)
  - The bot retrieves all messages from the channel (including bot responses) except command messages
  - Sends them to the AI model for summarization
  - Returns a formatted summary with the main topics and key points discussed
  - Creates an efficient thread: the initial message is edited with the summary content and a thread is created from it
  - Additional summary parts (if content exceeds Discord's character limit) are posted within the thread

- `/sum-hr <hours>`: Summarizes all messages in the current channel for the past N hours
  - Usage: `/sum-hr 6` (summarizes past 6 hours), `/sum-hr 12` (summarizes past 12 hours)
  - Works in any channel (not restricted to #bot-talk)
  - Flexible time range allows for more granular summaries than daily summaries
  - Creates an efficient thread with an appropriate name (e.g., "Summary - channel-name - 2025-05-30")
  - Same formatting and thread creation features as `/sum-day` command

### Automated Daily Summarization

The bot automatically generates summaries for all active channels once per day:

- Runs at a configurable time (default: midnight UTC)
- Summarizes messages from the past 24 hours for each active channel
- The summary posted in the configured general channel is a server-wide digest of all active channels
- Stores summaries in a dedicated database table with metadata including:
  - Channel information
  - Message count
  - Active users
  - Date
  - Summary text
- Posts summaries directly into each summarized channel
- Deletes messages older than 24 hours after successful summarization to manage database size

To configure the automated summarization:

```bash
# In .env file or environment variables
SUMMARY_HOUR=0  # Hour of the day to run summarization (UTC, 0-23)
SUMMARY_MINUTE=0  # Minute of the hour to run summarization (0-59)
SUMMARY_CHANNEL_IDS=CHANNEL_ID_1,CHANNEL_ID_2  # Optional: restrict per-channel daily summaries (general digest still uses all active channels)
```

## Database

The bot uses a SQLite database located in the `data/` directory with the following tables:

### Messages Table
Stores all messages processed by the bot, including:
- User messages
- Bot responses to commands
- Error messages
- Rate limit notifications

Each message is stored with metadata including author information, timestamps, and whether it's a command or bot response.

The messages table also includes fields for URL scraping functionality:
- `scraped_url`: URL extracted from the message
- `scraped_content_summary`: Summary of the content from the scraped URL
- `scraped_content_key_points`: Key points extracted from the scraped content

### Channel Summaries Table
Stores the daily automated summaries for each channel, including:
- Channel information (ID, name, guild)
- Date of the summary
- Summary text
- Message count
- Active users count and list
- Metadata (start/end times, summary type)

This comprehensive database structure allows for:

- Complete conversation history tracking
- User activity analysis
- Command usage statistics
- Channel summarization functionality
- Historical summary access
- Debugging and troubleshooting

The database is initialized when the bot starts up and is used throughout the application to store and retrieve messages and summaries.

### Database Migration

If you encounter database schema-related errors, you may need to run the database migration script:

```bash
python db_migration.py
```

This script will add any missing columns to the database tables that might have been added in newer versions of the bot.

### Database Utilities

You can use the `db_utils.py` script to interact with the database:

```bash
# List recent messages
python db_utils.py list -n 20

# Show message statistics
python db_utils.py stats

# List channel summaries
python db_utils.py summaries -n 10

# Filter summaries by channel name
python db_utils.py summaries -c general

# Filter summaries by date
python db_utils.py summaries -d 2023-05-30

# View a specific summary in full
python db_utils.py view-summary 1
```

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter database-related errors:

1. Make sure the `data/` directory exists and is writable
2. Check that the database is properly initialized in the `on_ready` event
3. Avoid importing the database module multiple times in different scopes
4. Check the logs for detailed error messages
